& The Strange Night in the Graveyard  

By Nathaniel Bott (s3605944) - Tested and working on Chrome and Firefox

Prof. Pugsworth is a styling scholar with a tendancy to run into strange video game-like situations at every turn. While visiting the grave of his dear friend Gabe, he comes across a strange tombstone and can't help but investigate. Looks like it's just another day in the life of Prof. Pugsworth

Boop
  Verb
    "The action of touching something on the nose or head in a cute manner."

Move using the WASD keys or the arrow keys. F allows you to interact with the big grave. In order to beat the boss you'll need to "boop" him, but be sure to avoid the bones he throws.

There aren't many bugs this time around. Collisions issues are still a major issues when they are arise and there is still no built in restart code, as this game isn't really built for replayability.
